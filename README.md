# E-StampBulkPrint
I developed a Python script that utilizes Selenium and Tkinter to print e-stamps in bulk without the need to enter form details repeatedly. With my script, users can enter their form details once and print as many e-stamps as they need, streamlining the process and saving valuable time.
You need to have Pyhton and Selenium installed on your system.
